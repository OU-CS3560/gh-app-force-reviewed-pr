# force-reviewed-pr

A GitHub bot that listens to the `create` event of the main branch via a webhook. It then applies
a branch protection rule that force any commit to the `main` branch to be made via a PR.

The framework used is GitHub's Probot. It is currently deployed to Google Cloud Function.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Production Deployment

Create GitHub App. The app must have these permissions

- Reposiotry level: `Read and Write` for `Administration`
- Reposiotry level: `Read` for `Contents`
- Reposiotry level: `Read` for `Metadata` (required by default)
- Organization level: `Read` for `Webhooks`

It must subscribed to the following events

- Create

Once the app is created, make sure it is installed to `OU-CS3560` organization.

Make sure that the `.env.yaml` is up-to-date. The `.env` is for a local development and will not be used during
the deployment.
